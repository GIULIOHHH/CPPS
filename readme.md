# What to do?
1. Read [How to submit](Useful/How%20to%20submit.md) .
2. Read [What algorithm to use](Useful/What%20algorithm%20to%20use.md).
3. Check [Time Complexity](Useful/Time%20Complexity.md). Given the constraints of a solution, depending on the numbers, it can be used to understand what algorithm should be used.
4. Read [Syllabus](Useful/Syllabus.md). These are the algorithms and required knowledge for the various difficulties (represented by books) in the OIS.

Optionally read below for more algorithms.
