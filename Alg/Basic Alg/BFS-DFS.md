# What 
2 ways to traverse a graph.

# Time Complexity
$$
O(v+e)

>where $v$ is the number of vertices and $e$ the number of edges.
# When 
They are used **whenever** a problem can be represented with multiple states that need to be visited.

>[!Note] 
>**Almost all problems** can be represented as a series of steps from the start to the end.
